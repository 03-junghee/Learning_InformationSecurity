<PASSIVE ATTACKS>

- X.800 and RFC2828 define this term.

- opponent wnat to obtain information that is being transmitted.

- Release of message contents
    -> A telephone conversation, an electronic mail message, and a transferred file may contain sensitive or confidential information.
    -> We would like to prevent an opponent from learning the contents of these transmissions.

(If you look at The Release of message contents.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

- Traffic analysis
    -> Because of using the encryption, opponents could not extract the information from the message even if they captured the message that is masked by encryption.
    -> opponents might be able to observe the pattern of these messages and determine the location and identify of communicating hosts and could observe the frequency and length of messages being exchanged.
    -> this information might be useful in guessing the nature of the communication that was taking place.

(If you look at The Traffic analysis.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

<ACTIVE ATTACKS>

- X.800 and RFC2828 define this term.

- opponent want to modify the data stream or create a false stream.

- Masquerade
    -> takes place when one entity pretends to be a different entity.
    -> For example, authentication sequences can be captured and replayed after a valid authentication sequence has taken place, thus enabling an authorized entity with few privileges to obtain extra privileges by impersonating an entity that has those privileges.

(If you look at The Masquerade.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

- Replay
    -> The passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent retransmission to produce an unauthorized effect.

(If you look at The Replay.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

- Modification of messages
    -> Some portion of a legitimate message is altered, or that messages are delayed or reordered, to produce an unauthorized effect.
    -> For example, a message meaning "Allow Jhon Smith to read confidential file accounts" is modified to mean "Allow Fred Brown to read confidential file accounts."

(If you look at The Modification of messages.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

- Denial of service
    -> Prevents or inhibits the normal use or management of communications facilities.
    -> This attack may have a specific target
    -> For example, an entity may suppress all messages directed to a particular destination (e.g., the security audit service).
    -> Another form of dervice denial is the disruption of an entire network, either by disabling the network or by overloading it with messages so as to degrade performance.

(If you look at The Denial of service.png, you can understand it in more detail.)

<DIFF BETWEEN PASSIVE ATTACKS AND ACTIVE ATTACKS>

- Difficulty to detect
    -> Passive Attacks > Active Attacks

- Difficulty to prevent
    -> Passive Attacks < Active Attacks

- Possibility to affect system resources
    -> Passive Attacks < Active Attacks
