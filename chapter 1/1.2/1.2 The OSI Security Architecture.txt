- Threat
    -> A potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm.
    -> A possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability.

- Attack
    -> An assult on system security that derives from an intelligent threat.
    -> An intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security services and violate the security policy of a system.

<OSI SECURITY ARCHITECTURE>

- ITU-T recommendation X.800, Security Architecture for OSI, defines such a systematic approach.

- Security attack
    -> Any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization.

- Security mechanism
    -> A process (or a device incorporating such a process) that is designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack.

- Security service
    -> A processing or communication service that enhances the security of the data processing systems and the information transfers of an organization.
    -> The services are intended to counter security attacks, and they make use of one or more security mechanisms to provide the service.
