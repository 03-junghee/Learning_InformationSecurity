CONFIDENTIALITY 

Student grade information is an asset whose confidentiality is considered to be highly important by students. 
In the United States, the release of such information is regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 
Grade information should only be available to students, their parents, and employees that require the information to do their job.
Student enrollment information may have a moderate confidentiality rating. 
While still covered by FERPA, this information is seen by more people on a daily basis, is less likely to be targeted than grade information, and results in less damage if disclosed. 
Directory information, such as lists of students or faculty or departmental lists, may be assigned a low confidentiality rating or indeed no rating.
This information is typically freely available to the public and published on a school’s Web site.

INTEGRITY 

Several aspects of integrity are illustrated by the example of a hospital patient’s allergy information stored in a database.
The doctor should be able to trust that the information is correct and current. 
Now suppose that an employee (e.g., a nurse) who is authorized to view and update this information deliberately falsifies the data to cause harm to the hospital. 
The database needs to be restored to a trusted basis quickly, and it should be possible to trace the error back to the person responsible. 
Patient allergy information is an example of an asset with a high requirement for integrity.
Inaccurate information could result in serious harm or death to a patient and expose the hospital to massive liability.
